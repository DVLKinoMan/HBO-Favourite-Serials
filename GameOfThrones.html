 <p>
 Game of Thrones has used seven writers over the course of five seasons. Series creators David Benioff 
and D. B. Weiss are the showrunners and write the majority of the episodes each season.

A Song of Ice and Fire author George R. R. Martin wrote one episode in each of the first four 
seasons, but has not written an episode for the fifth or sixth seasons, as Martin wants to focus 
on completing the sixth novel, The Winds of Winter.[35] Jane Espenson co-wrote one episode for the 
first season as a freelance writer.

Bryan Cogman, who initially was a script coordinator for the series, was promoted to a producer
 beginning with the fifth season. Cogman wrote at least one episode for the first five seasons, 
and is the only other writer to be in the writers' room with Benioff and Weiss; besides Vanessa Taylor,
 who was a writer during the second and third seasons. Dave Hill joined the writing staff for the fifth 
season after previously working as an assistant to Benioff and Weiss. Martin is not in the writers'
 room, but reads the script outlines and gives notes.

Benioff and Weiss sometimes assign various characters to each writer; for example, Cogman was assigned 
Arya for the fourth season. From there, the writers spend a few weeks writing a character outline, 
including what material from the novels to use and what the themes are. After the individual outlines are
 complete, the writers spend another two-to-three weeks discussing each main character's individual arc,
 and arrange them episode-by-episode.

From there, a detailed outline is created and each of the writers work on a portion of it,
 to create a script for each episode. Cogman, who wrote two episodes for the fifth season,
 took a month and a half to complete both scripts. The scripts are then read by Benioff and Weiss,
 who give notes, and then parts of script are rewritten. All ten episodes are written before filming begins,
 as all the episodes are filmed simultaneously, out of order, and using two separate units in different countries.

 <span>Tyrion Lannister(Peter Dinklage)</span>
 <p>
Tyrion is the third and youngest son of Lord Tywin and Lady Joanna Lannister. He is a dwarf.

Because of his unusual stature Tyrion has been a victim of mockery his entire life, with people overlooking his noble birth in order to tease and taunt him. He has also suffered physical indignities in a world not built for someone his size.

Tyrion's mother died giving birth to him and his father and older sister Cersei have despised him all his life as a result. He has always maintained a close relationship with his elder brother Ser Jaime Lannister, Cersei's twin.

Often underestimated because of his size Tyrion is actually one of the smartest, craftiest members of his family and wishes he was taken more seriously as an advisor. He is easily the kindest, understanding better than others those that have suffered hardship in their lives. He longs for true companionship and love since both have been withheld from him most of his life.

Because of the Lannister's wealth, Tyrion is also quite lazy and debauched given to drowning his familial woes in drinking and whores but is never truly satisfied. Although the women he lays with often seem to come away satisfied themselves and not just with their payment.

 <span>Cersei Lannister (Lena Headey)</span> 
 <p>
Cersei is the daughter of Lord Tywin Lannister, the richest man in all of Westeros and the late Joanna Lannister. She is the wife of King Robert Baratheon and as such is the Queen of the Seven Kingdoms.

She is twin sister to Jaime, with whom she maintains a very close relationship. She is elder sister to Tyrion for whom she only has disdain because he is a dwarf and their mother died giving birth to him.

Cersei is beautiful, cunning, and ambitious. She is wife to Robert Baratheon in name only, seeking affection elsewhere, but relishes her role as queen. She is fiercely protective of her children Joffrey, Myrcella, and Tommen and is not above taking down others in order to elevate them and the Lannister name.

In addition to her ruthlessness, Cersei is also quite funny, with a cutting and quick sense of humor.

Because Tywin was often away from their home at Casterly Rock serving as Hand to the King when she was young, Cersei, Jaime, and Tyrion were primarily raised by servants.

 <span>Daenerys Targaryen (Emilia Clarke)</span> 
 <p>

Daenerys is the only daughter of Aerys II Targaryen and Rhaella Targaryen.

She is now a princess living in exile, the last of the Targaryens.

Daenerys was born in the closing days of Robert's Rebellion after her father, "the mad king" had already been killed. Rhaella and her son Viserys, were evacuated to Dragonstone shortly before Aerys's death, where Rhaella gave birth to Daenerys in the midst of a violent storm that destroyed the remnants of the Targaryen fleet, leading to her moniker, Daenerys Stormborn. Her mother died giving birth.

Daenerys and Viserys were saved from capture by Ser Willem Darry and four other loyal men who were able to spirit them away to Braavos. Ser Willem looked after the children until he died several years later, and they were forced out into the streets. They wandered from city to city, ending up in Pentos, where Illyrio Mopatis took them in.

Although timid and unsure of herself at first Daenerys grows into a supremely confident warrior women with perhaps the most stringent code of ethics in all the Seven Kingdoms.

She believes she is the rightful heir to the Iron Throne and is on a mission to reclaim it.

 <span>Jon Snow (Kit Harington)</span> 
 <p>

Jon Snow is the bastard Son of Lord Ned Stark by an unknown mother.

Although he lives with his father, Jon does not know the identity of his mother since Ned has refused to admit her name to anyone, though he told King Robert Baratheon that her name was Wylla, a servant in the employ of House Dayne of Dorne.

Ned raised Jon alongside his natural born sons Robb, Bran, and Rickon, but Ned's wife Catelyn has always resented him and treated him with disdain and Jon has always felt like an outsider, never really part of the family. Ned's daughter Arya, however, is close to Jon and he gives her a sword named Needle.

When Ned leaves King's Landing to become Hand of the King for Robert Baratheron, Jon decides to join the Night's Watch. It is here that the skills that were passed on to him by Ned come to light as Jon becomes a natural born leader with a strong code of ethics and an effective warrior when battling at and beyond the Wall.
