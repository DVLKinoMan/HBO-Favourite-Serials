     <h2><span id="forhistory">Development and launch</span> </h2>
     <p>In 1965, Charles Dolan, who had already done pioneering work 
in the commercial use of cables and had developed a closed-circuit tourist
 information television system distributed to hotels in the New York metropolitan 
area called Teleguide, won a franchise to build a cable television system in the Lower 
Manhattan section of New York City. The new system, which Dolan named "Sterling Information
 Services" (later to be known as Sterling Manhattan Cable, and eventually becoming Time Warner Cable), 
became the first urban underground cable television system in the United States. Rather than stringing 
cable on telephone poles or using microwave antennas to receive the signals, Sterling laid underground 
cable beneath the streets of Manhattan – because the multitude of tall buildings in the city blocked
 television signals (besides that issue, the New York City Council had also required all electrical
 and telecommunication wires be laid underground to limit service disruptions during inclement weather
 conditions, resulting from a blizzard in the early 20th century that caused damage to telephone and telegraph 
lines in the area). That same year, Time-Life, Inc. purchased 20% of Dolan's company.

     <h2><span id="forhistory">List of channels</span> </h2>
     <p>Depending on the service provider, HBO provides up to thirteen multiplex channels – seven 24-hour
 multiplex channels, all of which are simulcast in both standard definition and high definition – as well 
as a subscription video-on-demand service (HBO On Demand).

HBO broadcasts its primary and multiplex channels on both Eastern and Pacific Time Zone schedules. 
The respective coastal feeds of each channel are usually packaged together (though most cable providers 
only offer the east and west coast feeds of the main HBO channel, as well as HBO2 in some cases), resulting 
in the difference in local airtimes for a particular movie or program between two geographic locations being 
three hours at most. The premium film service Cinemax, which is also owned by Time Warner through Home Box
 Office Inc., operates as a separate service from HBO; although HBO is very frequently sold together in a package
 with Cinemax, subscribers to one of the services do not necessarily have to subscribe to the other.

on HBO within a lag of between eight months to one year on average from their initial theatrical release – 
on Saturday nights (usually around 8:00 p.m. Eastern Time; the Pacific Time Zone broadcast of the premiered 
film airs later in the evening when a live special – most commonly, a telecast of HBO World Championship Boxing 
or HBO Boxing After Dark – is scheduled to air that particular Saturday, with the special being shown after the 
movie on the Eastern Time Zone feed). The main HBO channel mainly airs R-rated films only after 8:00 p.m. Eastern 
and Pacific, but does air certain TV-MA rated programs during the daytime hours.</td>

 Launched in 1991, the channel was renamed HBO Plus in April 1998, but reverted to the original "HBO2" name in September 2002.
 In Latin America, a local version of HBO2 rebroadcasts movies previously aired on the main HBO Latin America channel, and HBO 
Plus functions as a separate channel.</td>

              <td>Launched in December 1996, HBO Family features movies and series aimed at children, as well as feature
 films intended for a broader family audience. It airs a block of series aimed at preschoolers called "Jam" each morning 
from 6:00 to 11:00 a.m. Eastern and Pacific Time, with films and family-oriented original specials filling out the 
remainder of the channel's daily schedule.[47][48] All films broadcast on HBO Family are rated G, PG or PG-13
 (or the equivalent TV-G, TV-PG or TV-14); R-rated films and TV-MA rated programs are not broadcast on the channel.
 Children's programs formerly ran on the main HBO channel in the form of a daily morning block, with specials airing 
during the late afternoon/early evening hours; these programs migrated entirely to HBO Family by the early 2000s.

HBO Family is HBO's third (and only successful) venture at a family-oriented pay service: two similarly formatted 
standalone mini-pay services that were launched by the network, Take 2 in 1979 and Festival in 1987, both ceased 
operations after short existences. Despite being a premium service, cable providers have occasionally used HBO Family 
to temporarily replace television stations that were dropped due to carriage disputes with providers such as during 
Hearst Television's 2012 dispute with Time Warner Cable that resulted in TWC's associated Bright House Networks system
 substituting independent station WMOR-TV with the channel in Tampa, Florida,[49] and a dispute between Cox Communications
 and LIN TV in which HBO Family temporarily replaced Fox affiliate WVBT from Cox's Hampton Roads, Virginia system from January to February 2000</td>

simulcast of the primary HBO channel, with the exception of some limited program substitutions and different network 
promotions featured in-between programs (HBO and its other multiplex channels also utilize the second audio program 
function included on many television sets, and cable and satellite receivers to provide alternate Spanish language 
audio tracks of most programs). The channel's programming includes HBO original productions, Spanish and Portuguese 
series from HBO Latin America, dubbed versions of Hollywood blockbusters, Spanish-language films and boxing events 
(including the original boxing series Boxeo De Oro). The channel is the successor to HBO en Español (originally 
named Selecciones en Español de HBO y Cinemax), which launched in 1989.</td>
