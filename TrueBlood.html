 <span>Sookie Stackhouse(Anna Paquin)</span>
 <p>
 Sookie Stackhouse is a young woman with the mysterious power to hear other people's thoughts. She finds this ability overwhelming around other humans as she struggles to block out even their most mundane musings. Although the power gives her insight into people, it is often insight she would prefer not to have, as she hears even their cruelest opinions and creepiest thoughts. As a result, Sookie sometimes keeps to herself, and doesn't have much patience for social niceties, because she knows too well when someone is just being polite.

She can come across as stand-offish, sarcastic and blunt. When she was a child and even as an adult, sometimes people mistake her withdrawn nature for stupidity and treat her as though she is less intelligent than she is. Because she has been ignoring what people think of her her whole life, she does not have a hard time blocking out people's judgment when she begins openly dating vampire Bill Compton.

As she begins to learn more about the supernatural beings living around her in Bon Temps, she is drawn to them, in part because she cannot hear their thoughts and finally gets some peace and quiet when she is around them. Although she does not know where here ability comes from, she does know that this sets her apart from her fellow humans and most likely makes her supernatural in some way. As time goes on, she learns more about her heritage and her abilities and the role she plays in the supernatural world.

Her best friend is Tara Thornton, who was also a social outcast growing up because of her mother's alcoholism.

Sookie is independent, capable, brave and headstrong. She values sincerity and honesty.

Background: Sookie was born May 24, 1983. Her parents are Corbett and Michelle Stackhouse. When Sookie was a child, her mother was frightened by her abilities and put her into the mental health system, later dismissing her gift by saying Sookie was just very perceptive. Her parents were killed in a flash flood when Sookie was seven-years-old, although she has questions about the circumstances surrounding their deaths.

From that point on, Sookie and her brother Jason were raised by their grandparents, Earl and Adele Stackhouse.

When she was in their care, Sookie was molested by Adele's brother Bartlett, her uncle.

She works as a waitress at Merlotte's with Arlene Fowler. The owner, Sam, has a crush on her.

Something about Sookie's abilities draws vampires to her, including her first supernatural boyfriend, Bill Compton.

 <span>Bill Compton (Stephen Moyer)</span> 
 <p>
 Bill Compton is a vampire living openly among humans, having chosen to "mainstream" and co-exist after the Great Revelation.

He maintains the airs and manners of a 19th century gentleman. He is fiercely protective of people he cares about and believes in a vampire version of right and wrong, avoiding killing people he feeds upon and glamouring them to forget. He has a ruthless side that comes out when he attains a position of power.

Bill falls madly in love with Sookie Stackhouse as the series begins, and introduces her to the world of the supernatural.

Background: William Thomas Compton was born April 9, 1835 and lived in Bon Temps with his wife and two children, Thomas and Sarah, when the Civil War began. He fought with the 28th Louisiana Infantry. He was making his way home to his family after the war when he was turned into a vampire around 1865 by Lorena, who was angered when he spurned her advances. She brought out the worst of his vampire side, encouraging him to partake in orgies and killing sprees.

Bill and Lorena traveled to San Francisco in 1905 and visited the Comstock Brothel, run by Pamela Swynford De Beaufort, where they first encountered powerful vampire Eric Northman.

Bill visited his daughter on her deathbed in 1910 and refused her request to turn her into a vampire, believing it is a curse.

Bill continued traveling with Lorena, with stops in Chicago in 1926, and Los Angeles in 1935, after which they parted when he made clear that he was not in love with her.

Bill has a stronger resistance to the sun than some vampires and is able to glamour humans into doing what he wants. He has also proven able to imitate others' voices.

He is the maker of Jessica Hamby, an immature teenager, upon the orders of Magister, as punishment for killing another vampire. As her maker, Bill is responsible for teaching Jessica how to survive as a vampire.

 <span>Jason Stackhouse (Ryan Kwanten)</span> 
 <p>
Jason Stackhouse is the dim-witted, hormone-filled older brother of Sookie Stackhouse. Jason has a nearly insatiable libido and follows it into one misadventure after another, bedding many of the women in Bon Temps and the surrounding area. A character once says of him: "God gave that boy a penis and a brain, and only enough blood to run one of 'em."

Despite his playboy ways, Jason's innocence and naivete make him endearing and liked by many.

He is the supervisor on a road crew when the series begins, working with Lafayette Reynolds, Rene Lenier and his best friend, Hoyt Fortenberry. He later develops aspirations for joining law enforcement.

Jason is impressionable and very easily manipulated and often ends up the fall guy for other's bad actions. He has an addictive personality, as demonstrated by his sex drive, and has struggles with V, highly addictive vampire blood.

Jason is very loyal and thinks it is his responsibility to protect Sookie, which can cause friction with her boyfriends. Jason does not always think before he acts, but is usually able to escape close calls with quick thinking or dumb luck.

Background: He is three years older than Sookie. His parents are Corbett and Michelle Stackhouse. When Sookie was a child, her mother was frightened by her abilities and put her into the mental health system, later dismissing her gift as Sookie was just very perceptive. Their parents were killed in a flash flood when Jason was 11 years old.

From that point on, he and Sookie were raised by their grandparents, Earl and Adele Stackhouse. When Jason turned 18, he moved back into his parents' home and lived by himself, while Sookie continued to live with Adele.

He was a star quarterback in high school. Jason does not appear to have any of the same abilities that Sookie has.
