 True Detective is an American crime drama television series created and written
 by author Nic Pizzolatto. The series is broadcast by the premium cable network 
HBO in the United States, and premiered on January 12, 2014. The first season,
 consisting of eight episodes, starred Matthew McConaughey, Woody Harrelson,
 Michelle Monaghan, Michael Potts, and Tory Kittles. The second season is scheduled 
to premiere on June 21, 2015.

Engineered as an anthology, each season of True Detective will introduce new cast ensembles, 
characters, settings, and self-contained narratives. The show's first season is set in Louisiana
 and follows a pair of Louisiana State Police homicide detectives—Rustin "Rust" Cohle (McConaughey) 
and Martin "Marty" Hart (Harrelson)—and their pursuit of a serial killer over the course of seventeen years.
 True Detective‍‍ '​‍s second season will take place in California. Pizzolatto initially conceived 
the series as a novel, but later, as it began taking definite form, felt it was better suited for television.

True Detective has been highly acclaimed by critics and is cited as one of the strongest programs 
on television.The series was a candidate for numerous television awards, including a Primetime Emmy 
Award nomination for Outstanding Drama Series and Golden Globe Award nomination for Best Miniseries 
or Television Film, and won several other honors recognizing its writing, cinematography, direction, and acting.

 <span>Detective Rust Cohle (Matthew McConaughey)</span>
 <p>
Rust Cohle, one of the two protagonists in the television series, True Detective, works
 for the Louisiana State Police as a homicide detective. He is an intelligent and thorough 
detective whose ethics compel him to doggedly pursue a serial killer, and the power structure
 that seems to be involved with the torturous crimes, even when his pursuits threaten his career
 and well-being. Although he is talented and principled, he is also troubled and suffers from depression,
 drug abuse and alcoholism, and severe insomnia. His principles are sometimes eclipsed by these maladies, 
leaving him vulnerable to make mistakes that hurt him and others, including his partner, 
Marty Hart, with whom he shares a complicated and often conflicted bond. Despite his faults, he serves as the show's moral center.

 <span>Detective Marty Hart (Woody Harrelson)</span> 
 <p>
 Marty Hart, one of two protagonists of the television series, 
True Detective, works for the Louisiana State Police as a 
homicide detective. For several years, he enjoys a successful 
career and a good deal of support from his superiors, although
 he often has a troubled relationship with his wife and
 children due to his infidelities,volatile temperament, and 
reckless use of alcohol. Eventually his character flaws lead 
his loving wife to divorce him, while the grizzly serial murder
 case to which he is assigned haunts him and sparks his 
departure from the state homicide department. He starts
 working as a private investigator, hoping to stick to 
relatively easy and unimportant inquiries. Throughout the
 first season of the show, he has a complex and usually 
turbulent relationship with his partner, Rust Cohle, who 
challenges his conventional mores, as well as challenging 
him to continue their dangerous pursuit of a serial killer 
and a criminal power structure.
